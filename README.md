# Weather Forecasting with LLM

This Streamlit application combines weather data retrieval and analysis with the power of a Large Language Model (LLM) to deliver accurate, insightful, and interactive weather forecasting. The app also supports speech recognition, audio responses, and graphical visualization to enhance user experience.

## Features

### üå¶Ô∏è Weather Updates
- Fetch real-time weather data for any city worldwide.
- Display temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed.
- Provide a detailed weather description with insights and activity recommendations using the **Gemini LLM**.

### üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Map
- Visualize the selected city's location on a map.

### üìÖ Weekly Weather Forecast
- View a 5-day weather forecast with daily breakdowns.
- See daily minimum and maximum temperatures and weather descriptions.
- Icons for quick visual cues on weather conditions.

### üìä Temperature Graph
- Plot a graph of weekly minimum and maximum temperatures for easy trend analysis.

### üé§ Voice Interaction
- Record your voice to input the city name using the **audio_recorder** library.
- Use **Google Speech Recognition** to transcribe the voice input.
- Get audio responses for weather descriptions using **gTTS**.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Frontend for interactive user experience.
- **Gemini LLM**: Provides intelligent weather analysis and recommendations.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Supplies real-time weather data and forecasts.
- **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)**: Converts text responses to audio.
- **SpeechRecognition**: Enables voice-to-text functionality.
- **Matplotlib**: Generates temperature trend graphs.
- **Python**: Core programming language for all functionalities.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KaanSezen1923/streamlit-weather-app.git
